Creating custom ZEUS compositions in ArmA 3, X39 explains how (self.arma)
submitted 29 days ago * by KX39
Zeus is a pretty DAMN exciting mission mode but suddenly its lacking some important features … One of those features is the ability to add custom compositions so that you dont need to set up really EVERY mission from scratch …
Want a simpleToUse solution to add your own compositions? Well ^ ^ then read carefully:

Requirements:
binPBO/addonBuilder (ArmA 3 Tools) or any other pbo packaging tool
ArmA 3 (Trust me … you need it :F)
got everything you need? well then lets start!

STEP 1
Create your compposition using the editor/zeus or whatever you want to use inside of the mission editor

STEP 2
Place !YOUR PLAYER CHAR! (not the zeus controller for example) in the middle of your composition (will be used as 0 point so that you later will place the base around this place)

STEP 3
C&P this little script into your debug console (press ESC to open the debug console when youre admin/inside of the mission editor)

_nameOfCompositionFirstGroup = "by X39";
_nameOfCompositionSecondGroup = "FOBs";
_nameOfComposition = "ION FOB ALPHA";
_range = 500;
_filterAmmoboxes = true;
_classNameOfCompositionFirstGroup = [];
_classNameOfCompositionSecondGroup = [];
_classNameOfComposition = [];
{
    if(_x == 32) then
    {
        _classNameOfCompositionFirstGroup set[count _classNameOfCompositionFirstGroup, 95];
    }
    else
    {
        _classNameOfCompositionFirstGroup set[count _classNameOfCompositionFirstGroup, _x];
    };
    false
}count toArray _nameOfCompositionFirstGroup;

_classNameOfCompositionFirstGroup = toString _classNameOfCompositionFirstGroup;
{
    if(_x == 32) then
    {
        _classNameOfCompositionSecondGroup set[count _classNameOfCompositionSecondGroup, 95];
    }
    else
    {
        _classNameOfCompositionSecondGroup set[count _classNameOfCompositionSecondGroup, _x];
    };
    false
}count toArray _nameOfCompositionSecondGroup;

_classNameOfCompositionSecondGroup = toString _classNameOfCompositionSecondGroup;
{
    if(_x == 32) then
    {
        _classNameOfComposition set[count _classNameOfComposition, 95];
    }
    else
    {
        _classNameOfComposition set[count _classNameOfComposition, _x];
    };
    false
}count toArray _nameOfComposition;

_classNameOfComposition = toString _classNameOfComposition;
_strArr = toArray format["class CfgGroups%7{%7%8class Empty%7%8{%7%8%8side = 8;%7%8%8name = ""Compositions"";%7%8%8class %4%7%8%8{%7%8%8%8name = ""%1"";%7%8%8%8class %5%7%8%8%8{%7%8%8%8%8name = ""%2"";%7%8%8%8%8class %6%7%8%8%8%8{%7%8%8%8%8%8name = ""%3"";%7", _nameOfCompositionFirstGroup, _nameOfCompositionSecondGroup, _nameOfComposition, _classNameOfCompositionFirstGroup, _classNameOfCompositionSecondGroup, _classNameOfComposition, toString [13,10], toString [9]];
{
    _flag = false;
    _typeX = typeOf _x;
    if(_typeX == "Rabbit_F") then {_flag = true;};ares_zeusExtensions
    if(_typeX == "Snake_random_F") then {_flag = true;};
    if(_typeX == "GroundWeaponHolder") then {_flag = true;};
    if(_x == player) then {_flag = true;};
    if(_filterAmmoboxes && {_x isKindOf "ReammoBox_F"}) then {_flag = true};
    if(!_flag) then
    {
        _nulledPosition = [(position _x select 0) - (position player select 0), (position _x select 1) - (position player select 1), (position _x select 2) - (position player select 2)];
        _strArr = _strArr + toArray(format["%8%8%8%8%8class Object%1 {side=8;vehicle=""%2"";rank="""";position[]={%3,%4,%5};dir=%6;};%7", _forEachIndex, _typeX, _nulledPosition select 0, _nulledPosition select 1, _nulledPosition select 2, direction _x, toString [13,10], toString [9]]);
    };
}forEach  nearestObjects [position player, ["all"], _range];

_strArr = _strArr + toArray format["%2%2%2%2};%1%2%2%2};%1%2%2};%1%2};%1};", toString [13,10], toString [9]];
copyToClipBoard toString _strArr;


and execute it local
STEP 4
in your ArmA 3 installation, create a new folder callen “@WhatEverYouWantToCallIt” (the @ is important at the beginning!)
STEP 5
create another new folder inside of the newly created folder callen “Addons”
STEP 6
AND another folder inside the Addons folder (name it whatever you want to name it ^ but a basic convention is usually: MODDERTAG_MODNAME_PURPOSE)
STEP 7
create a file callen “config.cpp” inside of the folder you created in step 6 and fill it (using CTRL+V for example) with the magical content you got from step 3 inside of your clipboard (if you copied something else during the phase of step 4 and here then … yeah … execute step 3 again and come back to here! :F) You also need to add a CfgPatch class at the top (use this as template :F)
class CfgPatches
{
    class YOUR_ADDONFOLDER_NAME
    {
        units[] = {};
        weapons[] = {};
        requiredVersion = 0.1;
        requiredAddons[] = {"A3_Modules_F", "A3_Modules_F_Curator"};
    };
};

STEP 8
open your binPBO / Addonmaker (from the ArmA 3 tools) and set the addon source directory to the folder you created in step 6 the destination folder needs to be the Addons folder you created in Step 5 then finally click on Pack (or what ever seems to be the button to create some new file out of that folder)
STEP 9
Enable your addon in ArmA 3
STEP 10
Start a ZEUS mission and use your newly created composition (it could be required that the server also has this little addon you just created)
Ohh and by the way call yourself modder from now as you modified the game successfully
kindly regards X39 :F
